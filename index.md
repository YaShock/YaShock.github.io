## Projects

#### Formulator
A mathematical expression parser with advanced in-built formulas.
It was written in C++ using Qt. github.com/YaShock/Formulator

#### Neural network
A simple implementation of neural network in C++ program.
The network includes gradient check and dropout. github.com/YaShock/neural-network-cpp

#### Text analyzing system with natural language interface
For my thesis I wrote a text analyzing tool that integrates Elasticsearch, an ontology,
and R functions to manipulate uploaded documents. The system provides a RESTful service
and a natural language interface for those operations. github.com/YaShock/Thesis

#### Earley parser generator
I have written a parser generator in Python which generates an Earley parser from a grammar.
The grammar description is based on EBNF and is extended to include semantics in form of
arbitrary Python functions. github.com/YaShock/EarleyParser

#### Graphics assignment
A rolling sphere inside a torus with procedural textures and 2 moving light sources.
Written in C++ using OpenGL with glut.

#### Task manager
I have worked on a task manager application to gain experience in full-stack development.
Backend uses Flask for REST and SQLAlchemy for database, and a dedicated
front-end is implemented with Vue.js. 

## Education

###
**Budapest University of Technology and Economics**
`2014-2018`
Computer Science Engineering BSc (Systems Engineering specialization)

## Strengths

#### Teamwork
I have been working on a podcast with a German collaborator and I have participated in multiple
team.projects, programming competitions.

#### Abstract thinking, problem solving
Instead of using ad hoc methods I like to solve problems in a more abstract and reusable way.

#### Teaching and mentoring
I have been tutoring C++, C# and Java and mentoring my students on their projects
for the past two years. I have tutored in both English and Hungarian.

#### Eager to learn
I am comfortable with learning new skills and solving problems on the spot without prior studies
in the field. I learned Python, Scala and other platforms that are not part of the university
program.
