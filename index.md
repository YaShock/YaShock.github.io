## Projects

#### IsoEngine
It is an on-going 2D isometric game engine project built mostly for educational purposes. Its aim is to provide a lightweight 2D engine written in modern C++. Currently it uses SFML but it will be swapped for Vulkan.

#### Earley parser generator
It is a parser generator written in Python which generates an Earley parser from a description of grammar.
The grammar description is based on EBNF and is extended to include semantics in form of arbitrary Python functions.

#### Color generator
An application that can generate perceptually uniform palettes using CIE LCH(uv) space. It is based on the paper "Synthesis of color palettes" by MWH Martijn Wijffelaars. It was initially written in D using Gtk and later redesigned in C++ using wxWidgets.
