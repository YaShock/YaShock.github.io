## Projects

#### IsoEngine
It is an on-going 2D isometric game engine project mostly for educational purposes. It's aim is to provide a lightweight 2D engine written in modern C++. Currently it uses SFML but it will be swapped for Vulkan.

#### Earley parser generator
I have written a parser generator in Python which generates an Earley parser from a grammar.
The grammar description is based on EBNF and is extended to include semantics in form of
arbitrary Python functions.

#### Color generator
An application that can generate perceptually uniform palettes using CIE LCH(uv) space. It is based on the paper "Synthesis of color palettes" by MWH Martijn Wijffelaars. It was written in C++ using wxWidgets.

## Education

###
**Budapest University of Technology and Economics**
`2014-2018`
Computer Science Engineering BSc (Systems Engineering specialization)

## Strengths

#### Teamwork
I have been working on a podcast with a German collaborator and I have participated in multiple
team.projects, programming competitions.

#### Abstract thinking, problem solving
Instead of using ad hoc methods I like to solve problems in a more abstract and reusable way.

#### Teaching and mentoring
I have been tutoring C++, C# and Java and mentoring my students on their projects
for the past two years. I have tutored in both English and Hungarian.

#### Eager to learn
I am comfortable with learning new skills and solving problems on the spot without prior studies
in the field. I learned Python, Scala and other platforms that are not part of the university
program.
